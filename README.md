# Twitter Sentiment Analysis with Logistic Regression using Both C++ and Python
## Overview
I implemented a Logistic Regression model to classify whether tweets have a positive or negative sentiment associated with them. I used C++ at first to understand all the data-wrangling, feature extraction, training, and testing processes using Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning. Within C++, I coded string and vector data structures from scratch to perform this task, and I modeled the Logistic Regression function by coding a Gradient Descent algorithm from scratch. Then, I used similar methods in Python to better understand the full capabilites of NLP using data visualizations and TF-IDF, so I could achieve a higher testing accuracy and understand the classification process on a deeper level. My final Python testing accuracy for correctly classifying Tweet sentiments was 76.58%, while my C++ testing accuracy was 69.79%.
