# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis-in-Cpp-vs-Python
 Implemented a Logistic Regression model using Gradient Descent to classify whether tweets have a positive or negative sentiment associated with them. I used C++ at first to understand all the data-wrangling, training, and testing processes using Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning. Then, I used similar methods in Python to better understand the full capabilites of NLP so I could achieve a higher testing accuracy.
