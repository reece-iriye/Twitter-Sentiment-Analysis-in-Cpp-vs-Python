# C++: Twitter Sentiment Analysis with Logistic Regression
I implemented a Logistic Regression model to classify tweets as either negative or positive by implementing my own Gradient Descent algorithm from scratch. I spent approximately a month working on this project, and I'm excited to share my journey implementing Logistic Regression from scratch here! ðŸ˜ƒðŸ“š
## Implementation Steps
### Creating my Own String and Vector Classes
Instead, of using standard template libraries for strings and vectors, this project challenged me to further understand data structures by implementing my own DSString and DSVector classes from scratch. I developed a much stronger understanding of Object-Oriented programming, assignment operators, iterators, and more by creating my own classes.
### Reading in the Training File
With developing my own string class came the obstable of reading in the file without standard template library strings. I used stringstreams to perform this task, then immediately converted to
